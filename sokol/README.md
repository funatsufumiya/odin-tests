# Sokol odin examples

## Pre-requisites

### Install sokol-odin

This examples assume `import "shared:sokol"` works. So you need:

- First, `git clone` [https://github.com/floooh/sokol-odin](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-odin)
- and build it by reading [README](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-odin/blob/main/README.md)
- then, copy `sokol` folder in it into `$ODIN_ROOT/shared/sokol` (`$ODIN_ROOT` is the same folder of `which odin`)
